# Harness identity injection

Every session agent-deck launches is told, at runtime and in a form the model
can read, that it runs inside agent-deck, what its own session identity is,
and how to use the `agent-deck` CLI from inside. This works in every harness
(`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `omp`, `gemini`) and, through an environment
variable, in custom `--cmd` sessions too.

## What the session learns

A short block (well under 40 lines) is generated from the session's database
record on every start and restart:

```
# agent-deck session context
You are running inside agent-deck, a terminal session manager for AI coding agents. ...

## This session (snapshot from the agent-deck database at launch)
- session id: 8c211446-1789219548
- title: after-claude
- tool: claude
- group: after
- profile: default
- account: (none)
- parent session id: (none: this is a root session)
- project path: /path/to/project

## agent-deck CLI (flags go BEFORE positional arguments)
- `agent-deck session current --json` — this session's full, current metadata ...
- `agent-deck session send <id-or-title> "message"` — ...
- `agent-deck session output <id-or-title>` — ...
- `agent-deck launch <path> -t "Title" -c claude --message "prompt"` — ...
- `agent-deck session children --json` — ...
- `agent-deck inbox drain --json <id>` — ...
- `agent-deck list --json` — ...

## Completion sentinel
When a task you were given by a parent is fully done, end your final message with exactly one line:
===AGENTDECK_DONE=== status=<ok|fail> summary=<one line>
...
This block is at $AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE and is regenerated on every start/restart.
```

The block is written to `<data-dir>/agent-deck/runtime/identity/<session-id>/identity.md`
(plus a `GEMINI.md` copy for gemini). Its path is exported to the session as
`AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE`. It is a launch-time snapshot; the existing
`AGENTDECK_*` environment variables and `agent-deck session current --json`
remain the machine-readable source of truth and always reflect the database.

Nothing is ever written into the project directory: no `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` is created or edited there.

## Mechanism per harness

| Tool | How the block reaches the model | Restart / resume | Not covered |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `claude` | `--append-system-prompt-file <file>` (Claude's own prompt is kept) | yes, incl. `--resume` and forks | custom `[claude].command` wrappers, `claude <subcommand>` passthrough: env var only |
| `codex` | `-c developer_instructions="<block>"`, the block inlined as a TOML basic string (lossless for any title/path); a `developer_instructions` you configured in that launch's `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` is placed first so it is never replaced. `model_instructions_file` would replace the base prompt and is not used | yes, incl. `resume` / `fork` | custom codex commands (`-c "codex --flag"`): env var only |
| `pi` | `--append-system-prompt <file>` | yes, incl. `session fork` | |
| `omp` | `--append-system-prompt <file>` (Oh My Pi, same shape as `pi`; upstream docs `docs/cli-reference.md`) | yes, incl. `session fork` | |
| `gemini` | `--include-directories <dir>` with `GEMINI.md` inside, loaded as project memory next to the project's own | yes, incl. `--resume` | see folder trust below |
| custom `--cmd`, opencode, cursor, copilot, crush, hermes, deepseek | `AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE` in the environment | yes | no prompt injection; the command decides whether to read the file |
| plain shell session (`shell`, no command) | `AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE` exported into the pane shell by one line typed at start, together with `AGENTDECK_INSTANCE_ID`, `AGENTDECK_PROFILE`, `AGENTDECK_TOOL` and `AGENTDECK_TITLE` (the pane shell was already running when tmux's session environment was set, so an export is the only way to reach it) | yes | the line is visible in the pane; it is space-prefixed so a history that ignores such lines skips it |

SSH (`--ssh`) and Docker-sandboxed sessions are skipped entirely: the file
lives on the controller host and would not be visible where the harness runs.

A session created on a remote through `remote <name> add` or the TUI dialog
is spawned by that remote's own agent-deck, so it gets the block like a local
session there: the file is written on the remote, and `$AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE`
in the session is a path on that host.

A session switched to another harness (`session switch-harness`, #2237) is a
new instance in the new harness; its launch command carries the new
session's own identity block through that harness's flag, while the journaled
launch plan stays unchanged.

The block ends with a deference clause: instructions from the operator, from
project or conductor files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) and from
the task prompt take precedence. Nothing existing is replaced: claude gets an
appended prompt (never `--system-prompt`), codex keeps its built-in
instructions and any configured `developer_instructions`, pi appends, and
gemini loads the block next to the project's own context files. Record
fields are rendered on one line each (control characters collapsed), so the
block stays under 40 lines whatever a title contains.

### Gemini and folder trust

Gemini CLI's folder trust (on by default) asks "Do you trust the following
folders being added to this workspace?" for any `--include-directories` path
that no rule in `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` covers. That dialog swallows
the initial message `agent-deck launch -m` types, so agent-deck only passes
the flag when it can establish that no dialog will appear:

- folder trust is disabled (`security.folderTrust.enabled = false` in gemini's
  `settings.json`), or
- a `TRUST_FOLDER` (or covering `TRUST_PARENT`) rule exists for the identity
  root, `<data-dir>/agent-deck/runtime/identity`.

Otherwise the gemini session starts without the flag, gets only
`AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE`, and the pane prints a one-line hint naming the rule
to add. To enable it once for all gemini sessions, add the identity root to
`~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` (`GEMINI_CLI_HOME` and
`GEMINI_CLI_TRUSTED_FOLDERS_PATH` are honoured the way gemini honours them):

```json
{
  "/Users/you/.local/share/agent-deck/runtime/identity": "TRUST_FOLDER"
}
```

The directory only ever contains the identity block for that one session.

## Turning it off

```toml
# config.toml (global)
[launch]
inject_identity = false
```

```bash
# per session, persisted so restarts honour it
agent-deck add --no-identity -t "Plain" -c codex .
agent-deck launch --no-identity . -c claude -m "..."
```

The TUI New Session dialog has no row for this in this release; use the CLI
flag or the config key.

## Context levels (issue #2260)

`inject_identity = false` is an all-or-nothing switch. Context levels give
three sizes of the same block instead of just on/off:

| Level | What is written |
|-------|------------------|
| `none` | nothing — no file, no harness flag (same as `inject_identity = false` / `--no-identity`) |
| `primer` | a short block: session id, title, tool and parent only, no CLI reference or skills list |
| `full` | the block shown above (session record + CLI reference + skills + completion sentinel) — the only behaviour that existed before this issue, and the default |

Precedence is **global < group < session**: the nearest, most specific
setting wins.

```toml
# config.toml — global default
[launch]
context_level = "primer"   # none | primer | full

# per group, walks ancestor groups like other [groups."<path>"] overrides
[groups."conductor/workers"]
context_level = "full"
```

```bash
# per session, persisted; restart required (baked into the spawn command)
agent-deck session set <id> context-level primer
agent-deck session set <id> context-level ""       # clear: inherit group/global
```

The legacy `--no-identity` per-session opt-out keeps meaning `none` and
keeps winning over a positive `context_level` at any layer (backward
compatibility for an operator who set it before this issue existed). The
legacy *global* `inject_identity = false`, however, is just the global
layer's value: a group or session `context_level` overrides it, the same as
any other global < group < session precedence.

### Inspecting what a session actually gets

`agent-deck session primer [id]` resolves the level for a session (or the
current one, auto-detected, if `id` is omitted) and prints exactly the text
that session's harness receives — or would receive on its next
start/restart — plus which layer decided the level:

```
$ agent-deck session primer my-project
Session:       my-project (8c211446-1789219548)
Context level: primer
Source:        group:conductor/workers
Identity file: /Users/you/.local/share/agent-deck/runtime/identity/8c211446-1789219548/identity.md

# agent-deck session (primer)
You are running inside agent-deck, a terminal session manager for AI coding agents.
- session id: 8c211446-1789219548
- title: my-project
- tool: claude
- parent session id: (none: this is a root session)
Run `agent-deck session current --json` for the full record and CLI reference.
It is at $AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE and is regenerated on every start/restart.
```

`--json` gives the same fields programmatically (`context_level`, `source`,
`active`, `identity_file`, `text`, and `skip_reason` when injection is
skipped for an SSH/sandboxed session or the level is `none`). `source` is one
of `session`, `session (--no-identity)`, `group:<path>`, `global`,
`global (inject_identity=false)`, or `default`. Fields that are unset on the
session record render as `(none)` (or `(none: this is a root session)` for
the parent) exactly as the full block does — the command never invents a
value that isn't on the record.

## Verifying

Inside any session: `echo $AGENTDECK_IDENTITY_FILE`, `cat` it, or run
`agent-deck session current --json`. From outside, the flag is visible on the
pane's start command (`tmux display-message -p '#{pane_start_command}'`), or
run `agent-deck session primer <id>` to see the resolved level and text
without attaching.
