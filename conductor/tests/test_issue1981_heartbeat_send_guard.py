"""Regression tests for issue #1981.

A routine/heartbeat ``session send`` types text and presses Enter. When the
target Claude Code pane is mid-interaction that Enter is destructive:

  (a) an open AskUserQuestion picker resolves to its highlighted default — the
      model receives an answer the user never gave; and
  (b) a composer holding the user's half-typed input gets overwritten.

Both states still report status ``waiting``, so status alone cannot gate the
send. ``heartbeat_loop`` now captures the pane and skips the cycle when
``_pane_blocks_automated_send`` reports either state; any capture/parse failure
fails OPEN (the send proceeds) so heartbeats are never permanently blocked.

#2080 review: picker/busy detection is now gated on the hook-driven signal
first (see test_issue2080_hook_gates_heartbeat.py) — the pane-text picker
check below is exercised through this file's pre-#2080 call shape (no hook
args), which is the fallback path used only when the hook signal is unknown.

These are pure function tests on synthetic pane strings — no agent-deck runtime
and no third-party packages required.
