// contextWindowEnv is the override agent-deck honours when a user knows their
// deployment's window better than a model-name table can. It is unset by
// default; when it is set it wins, because a user-supplied fact beats an
// inference.
//
// It is an alias, not a second literal: every screen that meets an unknown
// window prints "set AGENTDECK_CONTEXT_WINDOW" as the remedy, and a remedy
// naming a variable this reader does not consult is worse than no remedy.
const contextWindowEnv = ctxtext.WindowEnvVar

// modelWindows maps model-identifier prefixes to context-window sizes,
// most-specific first.
//
// This is the project's one record of these sizes: internal/session resolves
// the analytics bar's window through [ResolveWindow] too, so a model taught
// here is taught everywhere. The lookup returns "unknown" for a family it does
// not recognise rather than a global default. A denominator invented for an
// unrecognised model turns an honest numerator into a misleading percentage,
// and a missing gauge is better than a wrong one.
//
// Detail carries provenance, never advice. The remedy — "set
// AGENTDECK_CONTEXT_WINDOW" — is owned by [ctxtext] and printed by every
// surface, so spelling it here too would put the same sentence on screen twice
// and let one copy rot.
//
// family marks an entry that stands for a whole model family rather than one
// release. A family entry answers for a minor version it has not been taught by
// assuming the window of the closest taught release at or below it — see
// [assumeFamilyWindow] — and marks the answer [ctxinspect.WindowModelFamily] so
// no surface can present it as established. Every minor version that HAS been
// released still deserves its own row: an assumption is the fallback, not the
// plan, and leaving a shipped model to fall through to it is how a whole live
// fleet ends up reading a hedge instead of a fact.
