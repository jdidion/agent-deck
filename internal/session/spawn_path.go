// Spawn PATH (remote parity walk on g14, 2026-09-18).
//
// A remote agent-deck runs its `session start` under the PATH of a non-login,
// non-interactive SSH shell, and the tmux server it starts (and every pane on
// it) inherits that PATH. The user's own tools are usually installed under
// ~/.local/bin (`claude` on g14 is a symlink there), which a login shell adds
// and this environment does not, so the pane ran `exec ... claude ...`, got
// "command not found", and died in 261ms as a generic spawn_died_fast. The
// same gap is why `remote update` warns that a deployed ~/.local/bin binary
// is off the non-interactive PATH.
//
// The rule: the spawn environment prepends the standard user bin dirs that
// are missing from PATH, exactly once, in this documented order, without
// reordering anything the user already has:
//
//  1. $HOME/.local/bin
//  2. $HOME/bin
//  3. the directory of the running agent-deck binary
//  4. /opt/homebrew/bin (macOS only)
//  5. the directory of an explicitly configured agent_deck_path (--ssh)
//
// A candidate is prepended only when it is an absolute path to an existing
// directory that is not world-writable and is owned by the current user or
// root (spawnPathDirUsable): the prelude puts these dirs in FRONT of every
// tool the session and its children launch, so a directory anyone else can
// write to (/tmp, a shared checkout) must never get there, whichever binary
// happened to be run. It is applied on every host, remote or local, so a
// session behaves the same wherever it is spawned. The prepend happens inside
// the pane command (buildSpawnPathExport) rather than in the deck process's
// own environment because a tmux server that is already running keeps the
// PATH it was born with: only the command itself is guaranteed to run in the
// pane.
//
// A tool that still cannot be found is reported as
// "tool not found on PATH: <tool> (searched: <PATH>)" instead of the generic
// fast death, but only on the pane's own evidence: a probe run inside the
// pane environment after the PATH prelude (spawnToolProbe). The deck
// process's PATH is never consulted for that verdict, because the pane may
// resolve the tool through a richer tmux PATH, a launch shell's aliases and
// functions, or an env file; without the pane's evidence the generic reason
// stands together with the dying output.
