// Package procowner implements the durable process-ownership receipt for
// agent-deck sessions (#1873).
//
// # The contract
//
// A session launched through a wrapper can lose its tmux pane while the wrapped
// process tree survives, reparented to PID 1. agent-deck then records the
// session as errored, and a later legitimate restart spawns a SECOND tree
// against the same instance, worktree and conversation. Nothing in the existing
// sweeps sees the survivor: they walk a live pane tree (there is none) or scan
// tmux sessions (the survivor is outside tmux).
//
// The maintainer ruling on #1873 fixes the primitive:
//
//   - the durable ownership receipt is the start-time + PID pair, recorded AT
//     SPAWN;
//   - the identity check is same PID AND same start time;
//   - any mismatch is a stranger and must not be signalled;
//   - no external provider and no new dependencies;
//   - an unverifiable process is reported as unknown and left alone.
//
// "At spawn" is the whole point. Reading a process's start time at sweep or
// kill time proves only that the pid did not change hands between the read and
// the signal; it says nothing about whether we ever owned that process. A
// receipt written while the process is provably ours is what turns a pid into
// ownership.
//
// # Leader and members
//
// The leader is the pane's initial process, captured the instant tmux reports
// it. Members are its descendants, each recorded with its own start identity
// while it is still attributable — that is, while it is reachable from the
// verified-live leader by a parent walk. Attribution is only ever performed
// during the spawn window and only downward from a leader whose identity still
// matches the receipt; the sweep and kill paths never extend a receipt, they
// only verify it. A member's recorded start identity must additionally be no
// older than the leader's, because a descendant of a process cannot have
// started before it — a cheap invariant that keeps a mid-scan pid recycle from
// widening the receipt.
//
// A process that detaches (setsid) AND outlives its whole recorded ancestry
// before any attribution pass observes it is, by construction, not attributable
// to a PID+start-time receipt. Such a process is never recorded and therefore
// never signalled: unowned, not "owned by guess". Closing that last gap needs a
// containment primitive (cgroup/job object), which the ruling explicitly did
// not take.
