// Reap terminates every identity in the receipt that still verifies as ours,
// and nothing else.
//
// The rules, in order of importance:
//
//  1. Identity is re-verified immediately before every signal. A pid that has
//     been reused, cannot be read, or now belongs to another user is left
//     alone and reported — never signalled, not even with SIGTERM.
//  2. Descendants are signalled before the leader, so the tree is not
//     re-parented mid-reap.
//  3. Death is verified, not assumed: SIGTERM the whole set, wait, SIGKILL
//     whatever is left, wait again. A process that survives both is reported
//     still alive and the receipt is NOT cleared.
//
// The waiting is per PHASE, not per process. Reaping members one at a time
// would multiply the grace period by the size of the tree, and this runs on the
// teardown path — a session with a dozen stubborn children would take a minute
// to stop. Signalling the whole set first also gives a parent and its children
// the same window to shut down cleanly.
//
// Where the Signaler can pin (Linux with pidfd), the verify-then-kill window is
// closed outright: the handle is opened first, the identity is verified second,
// and the signal goes through the handle; a handle that cannot be obtained
// leaves the member unsignalled. Where the host has no handle mechanism at all
// (macOS; a Linux kernel before 5.3), the window between the verify and the
// kill syscall remains: it is microseconds wide, requires the pid space to wrap
// inside it, and SIGTERM — the only signal that can land there first — is
// survivable. Everything after that first signal is re-verified.
