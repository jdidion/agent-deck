// isLiveTmuxClientOrServer spawns two tmux clients per candidate and memoizes
// nothing. On the host this sweep exists for, that is up to two spawns per
// wedged orphan — each one a fresh client against the same unresponsive server,
// and so itself a candidate for the fd leak being cleaned up — with each pair
// riding tmuxLiveQueryTimeout, so a handful of candidates can spend the whole
// shared budget and the rest are reported unexamined.
//
// The obvious fix is to cache the answers, and the PR body rejects it for a
// real reason: a cached client list goes stale inside one sweep, and a client
// that connects mid-sweep would then be absent from the cache and eligible to
// be killed. Freshness is the safety property.
//
// What IS cacheable is the refusal. "This socket could not be reached" only
// ever produces more refusals, never a kill, so memoizing it is fail-closed by
// construction — and it is precisely the expensive case, since an unreachable
// or wedged server is what makes a query ride its full cap.
