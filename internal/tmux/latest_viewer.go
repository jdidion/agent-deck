// Shared view: agent-deck's control clients and the window's latest client.
//
// `window-size latest` sizes a window to its *latest* client. tmux never sizes
// a window from a control-mode client that has not asked for a size (resize.c
// ignore_client_size), but it does not keep such a client out of the latest
// slot (tmux 3.3a to 3.6a):
//
//   - attaching makes the attaching client the window's latest client,
//     control clients included (server-client.c server_client_set_session);
//   - when the latest client leaves, tmux hands the slot to the most recently
//     active client left on the window (server_client_attached_lost). A
//     control client's activity is its attach time, and the PipeManager pins
//     a pipe to every attached session, so it attaches right after the people
//     it follows and is the newest.
//
// With two or more people on the window, a control client in the latest slot
// makes tmux compute no size at all: the window stays frozen at the size it
// had, typically that of somebody who has left, and everyone still on it sees
// a small box of dots until one of them types or resizes. Agent Deck's control
// clients are the PipeManager's pipes and the insert-mode KeySender.
//
// HandLatestToViewer gives the slot back to a person. tmux has no command that
// sets the latest client: a client takes it by sending a resize, which its
// `tmux attach` process does on SIGWINCH (client.c) without changing the
// terminal's size.
//
// A control client that asked for a size (`refresh-client -C`, as iTerm2's
// `tmux -CC` integration does) is a person too: tmux sizes the window from it
// and it may hold the slot. Only size-less control clients are nobody.

// latestSettle is how long a client event is left to settle before the slot
// is judged: tmux announces an attach before the newcomer's first resize,
// which is what makes the newcomer the latest client, and a hand-back in
// between would take the window from them.

// latestCandidateFormat is the list-clients format parseLatestCandidates reads.
const latestCandidateFormat = "#{client_pid}\t#{client_flags}\t#{client_activity}\t#{client_width}\t#{client_height}\t#{window_id}\t#{status}"

// latestCandidate is a client on a window that may hold the window's latest
// slot. cols x rows is the window size it asks for (its terminal minus its
// status lines). A control candidate is never signalled and only its width is
// known: tmux reports no height for a control client.

// It does nothing unless the window's policy is `latest` and two or more
// people are on it (with one, tmux sizes the window to that person whoever
// holds the slot). Otherwise it signals the person whose terminal the window
// already fits, so a control client's attach changes nothing on screen, or,
// when it fits nobody (it is frozen at a departed client's size), the most
// recently active person: tmux's own rule for a departed latest client, minus
// the control clients. Best effort: every failure leaves tmux as it was.
