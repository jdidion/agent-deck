// Regression tests for #2214: every pane inherits the tmux SERVER's cwd
// instead of the session's project directory, so a server whose own cwd has
// been deleted (e.g. because it was started from a worktree that was later
// removed) kills every subsequent spawn on that server in ~256ms, with no
// non-destructive recovery.
//
// #1713 (SpawnBaseDir, resolveStartWorkDir, verifyPaneWorkDir in
// workdir_guard.go) prevents agent-deck's OWN spawns from poisoning a server
// (every server agent-deck starts now runs from "/"), and it detects an
// already-poisoned pane after the fact and fails loudly instead of reporting
// a healthy session that never ran the agent. But detection alone leaves no
// way forward: a server poisoned before the #1713 fix shipped, or started by
// something other than agent-deck's own spawn path, fails every start
// forever, and the only way out (kill-server) takes every sibling session
// with it.
//
// Root-cause fix (this issue): don't rely on the SERVER's cwd (via tmux's own
// -c) at all. Every new-session / new-window spawn now asserts its own
// directory from inside the pane's command, via a `cd -- <dir> &&` prefix
// (cwdAssertCommand in tmux.go). The shell builtin `cd` operates on the
// filesystem directly — it does not depend on the process's inherited cwd
// being valid — so it lands the pane in the right place even when the tmux
// server's own cwd is unlinked. This closes the gap for good instead of
// retrying after detecting a failure: the FIRST spawn already lands right.
//
// TestStart_SurvivesExternallyPoisonedServer is the failing-first test: it
// builds a real tmux server whose OWN cwd is unlinked (simulating "started by
// another tool", exactly the case #1713's SpawnBaseDir prevention cannot
// retro-fix), never touching agent-deck's spawn path to create it, then
// starts a session against that poisoned server through Session.Start. On
// main (before this fix) this fails with ErrPaneCwdDeleted — the pane really
// does land in the dead directory, matching the issue's own bare-tmux repro.
// After the fix, Start succeeds on the first attempt and the pane's actual
// process runs in the requested directory.
