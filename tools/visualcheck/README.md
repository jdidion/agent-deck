# Visual check

This tool drives the real agent-deck binary through a seeded gallery in a private tmux server and sandbox HOME. It captures 15 named frames at each of 80x24, 120x40 and 200x50, compares them with committed goldens, and writes `contact-sheet.html` and `visualcheck-report.json` in the working directory.

Run the complete package on the isolated test box through `g14-test.sh <repo-dir> -count=1 -timeout 30m ./tools/visualcheck`. This runs the unit tests and the real-binary walkthrough. The integration test builds the binary when `VISUALCHECK_BINARY` is unset. The standalone command is `go run ./tools/visualcheck <agent-deck-binary>` on Linux. `make visual-check` wraps that command.

To regenerate goldens on the test box, run `g14-test.sh <repo-dir> -run TestVisualCheckRegenerateGoldens -timeout 30m ./tools/visualcheck -args -visualcheck.regenerate`, copy the resulting goldens from the isolated checkout, and inspect every frame. `make visual-check-golden` is the local equivalent. **A diff needs a reviewer's PASS** before updated goldens are accepted.

A required screen that cannot be reached, is not captured, or differs from its golden fails the check. `advisoryReasons` in `capture.go` is the explicit exclusion list and is currently empty. Retries only recover navigation; exhaustion is an error. The report always includes one row per expected screen and width.

The gallery contains alpha and beta groups, a backend subgroup, idle/waiting/running/stopped/error sessions across tools, a fake remote, and a Hindi/emoji Claude response. Each width gets a fresh store and private tmux server. The update step installs a higher-version binary inside that sandbox, waits for the real installed-update banner, captures it, presses Ctrl+T, and confirms the restart. No production code or external update service is involved.

After detach, a redraw probe sends rapid navigation onto and off a session, then saves immediate, settled, and forced-repaint panes under `$TMPDIR/visualcheck-artifacts/redraw/` (outside the checkout, so the release tree stays clean). It fails if a waiting or stopped session row persists twice in the settled sessions column. The forced repaint waits for Help to open and close before sampling.

The scrubber replaces UUIDs, short IDs, semantic versions, clock times, ISO dates, relative ages, `just now`, the private tmux socket, sandbox paths, the shell prompt, tmux label and startup echo, the host name, and the padding after a VS16 emoji (one or two cells depending on the tmux build). `3m ago` becomes `<age> ago`. The sandbox header omits live CPU and disk measurements. Polls use screen predicates; short sleeps remain in navigation and tmux frame-settling code. Captures require stable, screen-specific text, then golden equality.
