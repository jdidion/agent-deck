// (so callers resolve exactly once per send; see performSend). It never
// touches the filesystem or a live process directly — all of that lives
// behind the resolve seam — which is what makes every branch here
// table-testable without a real Claude session.
//
// --draft never reaches this function: handleSessionSend returns before
// calling performSend when --draft is set (session_cmd.go's --draft branch
// pre-fills the composer and returns), so there is no draft case to handle
// here.
//
// Decision order (cheapest / most certain first):
//  1. An SSH-backed instance always takes tmux. The messaging socket is a
//     Unix domain socket that must be dialed on the machine that owns it
//     (plan §4: remote/cross-machine sessions are out of scope); resolving a
//     local ~/.claude record for a remote instance's claudeSessionID would
//     be a coincidental collision at best, not the target the operator means.
//  2. Anything but a literal send_transport = "auto" takes tmux. The socket
//     is opt-in (maintainer review of #2100), so an explicit "tmux" pin, an
//     absent key and an unrecognized value all land on the historical
//     keystroke path; sendTransportFromConfig has already normalized and
//     warned, and this check is the same rule restated at the decision
//     boundary so a future caller cannot opt a user in by accident. The pin
//     and the not-opted-in cases report different reasons: both are
//     selector-level, but conflating them would describe a default as a
//     decision the operator made.
//  3. Non-Claude-compatible tools have no Claude messaging socket at all.
//  4. A bare slash command (e.g. "/compact") arrives over the socket as
//     literal text (skipSlashCommands=true is baked into the receiver —
//     §1.7.1 of the plan, verified against the 2.1.259 binary), so routing
//     it to tmux is the only way it still executes as a command.
//  5. No known Claude session ID for the target means there is nothing to
//     resolve a socket record for.
//  6. Otherwise, ask resolve(). A *send.Unavailable here is the only case
//     that reports a non-empty reason: every case above means a socket was
//     never a candidate to begin with, not that one was tried and refused.
