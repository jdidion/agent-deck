// Issue #1948 — `agent-deck remote drain <remote>`: the conductor-side PULL.
//
// A conductor on machine A that launches workers on machine B never learns when
// they finish. Transition notifications are parent-linked via
// parent_session_id, which cannot point across machines, and the inbox is
// filesystem-local — so finished reports sit unread on B and a quota-stalled
// remote session goes unnoticed for hours. The conductor's only recourse today
// is tmux-scraping or file polling.
//
// This command replaces that with one call: it runs the read-only `inbox
// export` on the remote over the EXISTING ssh path (SSHRunner — no new
// transport), and writes what comes back into the conductor's own local inbox.
//
// Why pull and not push: the conductor's own command IS the delivery event.
// There is no "did it arrive" question, therefore no ack channel, no retry
// ledger, and no delivery semantics to get wrong — the class of problem a
// previous push-relay design failed review on. Nothing on the remote is
// consumed, moved, truncated or marked, so two conductors draining the same
// host both get the records and the host's own conductor is unaffected.
//
// Idempotence is NOT re-implemented here. Records are written with
// session.WriteInboxEventIfNew, so the inbox's existing EventFingerprint dedup
// decides what is a duplicate; this command only reports the answer. Across a
// consumption boundary (the conductor drained its inbox, so the fingerprint set
// went with it) the #1225 consumer's turn_fingerprint ledger collapses the
// re-pulled record instead. Both layers already existed; the pull adds none.
//
// Ownership model: a remote is configured by this conductor
// (`agent-deck remote add <name> <user@host>`), and drain fetches what THAT
// host's agent-deck instance holds. Narrowing by parent is the deferred
// proposal (1) on #1948 (`--parent <conductor-id>@<host>`), which is sugar over
// this pull and is deliberately not built here.
